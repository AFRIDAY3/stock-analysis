# Stock-analysis

## Overview of Project: Purpose
    The purpose of this analysis is to compare stock trends between 2017 and 2018. It was to visualize the average return for each ticker per year. This displays whether there was a positive or negative return on each stock. Using a refactored code, stock performance results can be produced more efficiently. 

## Results 
### Original Vs. Refactored Script
  Below is the refactored script used to compare the stock performance for 2017 and 2018, with an example of how it was used to formulate the data for 2017. Based on the execution times the refactored script ran faster. The refactored script had ran in 0.34375 seconds while the original script ran in 0.7578125 seconds. The refactored script also provided a “tickerIndex” variable to make this code inclusive in the case additional stocks are added to the data in the future.

### Comparison of Stock Performance
  The total volume for stocks in 2017 was higher overall than 2018. The only loss according to VBA_Challenge_2017.png was from TERP with a loss of 7.2%. In 2017 DQ received the most positive return with an increase of nearly 200%. The year 2018 experienced mainly losses, with only ENPH and RUN having positive returns, according to VBA_Challenge_2018. ENPH had the highest in volume that year, followed by SPWR. RUN had the best increase in positive return, going from a 5% increase in 2017 to an 84% increase in 2018.

## Summary: Advantages and Disadvantages
  Advantages of refactoring code are producing quicker execution times and being able to add variables that can help the code to more applicable if more data were added to the set. However the original code is shorter than the refactored code and one would have to be wary of the errors that can come from changing or adding to the script. A cleaner code means efficient results, until a change in data or more must be added to the code.
